## Who is NHSR Community?

::: incremental
-   It's always good to introduce yourself
-   Me first!
-   Next the Community: short version is we are not just NHS and not just R
-   Longer version can be found at the [Toolshed](https://github.com/nhs-r-community)
:::

## What do we have

::: incremental
-   No GitHub site would be complete without a package (or two)
-   Books
-   Training materials
-   a [universe](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/universe)
:::

## It's all work in progress

Whilst work may be paused is it ever really complete?

## Adding tools to the toolshed

The GitHub account includes

::: incremental
-   projects from the [very beginning](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRplotthedots)
-   recently received transferred projects
-   Some of these are just passed on with [no further input](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/quarto-nhs-theme) - yet
-   Whilst others have continued to have [input from the creator](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRepisodes)
:::

## We can practice working as a team

A particular feature of team working is conversation and that can happen via

::: incremental
-   [Issues](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/demos-and-how-tos/issues)
-   [Pull Requests](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/demos-and-how-tos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
-   [Conversations](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRepisodes/pull/12)
:::

::: notes
An example of a good first issue resolved by someone https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r/pull/76 possibly not actually in the NHS-R Community but whose contribution was very welcome.
:::

## Everything needs documentation

Even a community!

::: incremental
-   Not everything is obvious to a new person
-   and a lot is not known even to people who have been involved for a while!
-   We can practice sharing using words before code
-   Following [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) we have the [NHS-R way](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/NHSR-way/)
-   Following [The GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/) we have (currently) a more technical guide [Statement on Tools](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/statements-on-tools/)
:::

## Just a reminder

We are called NHSR but we are not just the NHS and not just R

We share a common interest in health and care, data science tools and to quote the NHS-R way

> We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.

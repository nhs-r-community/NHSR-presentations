## Notebooks

I have a paper notebook with Excel formulae and SQL code from when I first started as an analyst. Code like:

. . .

`YEAR(DateColumn) * 100 + MONTH(DateColumn)`

which gave use the format `202406` in our analysis and

. . .

`SUBSTRING(xxx, CHARINDEX('x', xxx), 4)`

find `x` in column `xxx` and return 4 characters

::: notes
This book was incredibly useful for helping me "revise" the code but searching through it, like I did for this talk, is almost useless
:::

## Writing and searching

Fast forward a few years when I was learning R

. . .

I realised I couldn't search for things like I could like SQL

. . .

because I didn't know what things were called!

## Writing code and text

And whilst I was keeping notes on code there was all the other context and methodology information

. . .

And this was kept on Sharepoint which was restricted access

## DRY

**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself

. . .

well I was doing that all the time

. . .

And making **mistakes**

## Requirements

A solution needed to be:

::: incremental
-   Shareable
-   Searchable
-   Flexible
-   Combine code and text
:::

## The solution

I started off with a book

. . .

I ended up with a book

## Actually I ended up with several books

This link is in development and so won't repeat nhsrcommunity once published.

## And there is more

## Quarto solutions

Books, presentation slides and blogs lead to websites like this from the [Royal Statistical Society](https://realworlddatascience.net/)

. . .

Which lead to data science solutions like GitHub actions and Docker

## The end...

And many, many mistakes (also known as trial and error!)

## Thanks

To Matt Dray for [{quartostamp}](https://github.com/matt-dray/quartostamp) because I always forget what's possible in Quarto and how to write the code!

## Who are you? {.scrollable}

Before we start what programs do you usually use?

-   Excel
-   SQL
-   PowerBI
-   Tableau
-   Qlik
-   SPSS
-   STATA
-   R
-   Python
-   Something else...

## Who is NHS-R Community?

::: incremental
-   Whilst we are called NHS-R we are not just NHS and not just R!
-   Everyone is welcome!
-   We started in 2018 with funding R projects, a conference and training Introduction to R and R Studio
-   We still do training and...
:::

## ... we have created...

::: incremental
-   [Postcard](https://postcard.nhsrcommunity.com/) - using R and RMarkdown
-   [Website](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) - using Quarto
-   [Books](https://nhsrcommunity.com/books/) - using Quarto
-   [Training materials](https://nhsrcommunity.com/getting-started.html) of blogs, slides and recordings - using Quarto and YouTube
-   [GitHub](https://github.com/nhs-r-community) - where we share our code and publish these things **free**
:::

## Open source

Everything is in the open (including our mistakes as we learn):

## Everything needs documentation

Even a community!

::: incremental
-   Not everything is obvious to a new person...
-   ... and a lot is not known even to people who have been involved for a while!
-   We can practice sharing using words before code
-   Following [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) we have the [NHS-R way](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/NHSR-way/)
-   Following [The GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/) we have (currently) a more technical guide [Statement on Tools](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/statements-on-tools/)
:::

## Health Inequalities

It's not just code we share, it's our knowledge on the data we are using:

[Health Inqualities book](https://health-inequalities.nhsrcommunity.com/)

- Contributions to these don't have to be technical or use code
- The book has two "built in" ways to make comments, using either GitHub or Hypothesis.

## It's all work in progress

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Whilst work may be paused is it ever really complete?

What is important to us is [contribution, not output](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/nhs-r-community?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors)

## Senario 1

Creating an SPC (Statistical Process Control chart) for hospital admission data

## NHSRdatasets {.scrollable}

This R package has publicly available data to use for training.

Use code to create a "temporary table" called sub_set:

```{webr-r}
library(NHSRdatasets)
library(dplyr)

sub_set <- ae_attendances |>
  filter(org_code == "RQM",  # the hospital code
         type == 1, # the type of admission
         period < as.Date("2018-04-01")) # dates before 01/04/2018

sub_set
```

## NHSRplotthedots {.scrollable}

Using this SPC package which creates plots using the NHSE/I 'Making Data Count' rules and look:

```{webr-r}
library(NHSRplotthedots)

sub_set |>
  ptd_spc(
    value_field = breaches,
    date_field = period,
    improvement_direction = "decrease"
  )
```

## Scenario 2

Hospital episodes can overlap or have gaps which can result in under or over counting

## Create some data using code {.scrollable}

Using data created in code this time:

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup
webr::install("NHSRepisodes", repos = c("https://nhs-r-community.r-universe.dev"))
```

```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)

dat <- tribble(
  ~patient_id, ~admission, ~discharge, ~code, ~notes,
  1L, "2020-01-01", "2020-01-10", "t100", NA,
  1L, "2020-01-12", "2020-01-22", "t600", NA,
  2L, "2020-05-01", "2020-10-01", "t100", NA,
  2L, "2020-10-01", "2020-11-01", "t250", "same day discharge and admission"
) |>
  # columns must be date format to work with NHSRepisodes functions
  mutate(across(admission:discharge, as.Date)) 

dat

```

## NHSRepisodes {.scrollable}

This package has two functions, one adds the episode number to the data the other reduces the data to just one one line:

```{webr-r}

# Add a column to your data on the episode numbers
dat |>
  # Rename the columns so that they are recognised by the `add_parent_interval()` function
  select(
    id = patient_id,
    start = admission,
    end = discharge,
    ends_with("number")
  ) |>
  NHSRepisodes::add_parent_interval()

```

## Returning just one line

```{webr-r}

# Add a column to your data on the episode numbers
dat |>
  # Rename the columns so that they are recognised by the `add_parent_interval()` function
  select(
    id = patient_id,
    start = admission,
    end = discharge,
    ends_with("number")
  ) |>
  NHSRepisodes::merge_episodes()

```

## A learning environment

NHS-R Community is a learning environment:

::: {.incremental}
-   we have volunteers who develop and offer training
-   and we have technical spaces where you can practice
-   supported by a community in Slack to ask questions and connect with people
-   and if you make a mistake it will get lost amongst all of ours
:::


## Final reminder

We are not just the NHS and not just R

We share a common interest in health and care, data science tools and to quote the NHS-R way

> We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
